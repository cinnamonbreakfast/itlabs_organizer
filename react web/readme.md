# âš› Front-end

## Technologies

### 1. React - a powerful framework created by Facebook, that we used for front-end of this app.
### 2. NextJS - a framework build by Zeit that let us build server-side rendering and static web app of our React project. We chose to work with NextJS because it has a lot of advantages and features, one of the coolest being the routing system.
